# Summer Course: Programming Practice

This is the GitHub repository of the course "Summer Programming Practice 2020" for RUC Turing Class 2019. Please fork this repository and submit your project to the main repository with Pull Requests.

## ℹ️ Course Information

The main goal of this course is to write project code to solve real-world tasks. In specific, we focus on building a tiny search engine that is able to analyze, index, retrieve and mine the collected webpage pool. In this course, you will learn basic knowledge about information retrieval and natural language processing. The course is intended to start you in these exciting directions.

We encourage the students to implement the project with the programing languages of C++, Java and Python. We also emphasize that the code should be written in an object-oriented manner.

## 🕒 Time and Location

* 📅 **July 13** to **July 20**
* 🕒 Full-day course (08:30 - 11:30, break, 14:00 – 17:00)

## 💯 Grading

The grading policy is given as follows:

1. 🕊️ **Online attendance (30%)**
   <p>The student is required to attend the daytime course from <b>July 13</b> to <b>July 20</b>. Attendance will be checked regularly each day from Tencent Meeting. If the absence time in a day is more than an hour without any reasonable explanation, you will be penalized with a reduction of <b>5%</b> in the final score. (Suppose you missed one-day attendance, you will receive at most <b>25</b> points in this part). The reduction ratio will be aggregated by day if multiple absences have occurred.</p>
2. 👨‍💻 **Project code (55%)**
   <p>We release a check list for scoring the project code.</p>
3. 📝 **Course report (5%)**
   <p>The course report will be scored according to whether it contains sufficient content about the project code, including design, core components, functions and usage. You may consider it as an advanced version for README file. Note that the course report will be written in English with LaTeX. We will share the LaTeX template through the course group.</p>
4. 🙋‍♂️ **Selected presentation (10%)**
   <p>We will select a ratio of students who will make the final presentation. The choice will be made according to the quality of the prepresentation and the willing of the students.</p>
